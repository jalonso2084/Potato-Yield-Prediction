Overview
Potato yield prediction plays a crucial role in modern agriculture, addressing food security and sustainable farming challenges. This project integrates semi-mechanistic modeling, machine learning, and data assimilation to estimate potato yields effectively across different regions and environmental conditions, with a primary focus on Prince Edward Island (PEI).

Key Highlights:

Designed to optimize potato production strategies in PEI's unique environmental and agronomic conditions.
Combines vegetation indices, soil properties, and climate data for yield estimation.
Evaluates various predictive models, including regression models, machine learning, and hierarchical linear models (HLM).
Optimized for scalability and transferability across ecological environments.
Features
Focus on PEI Potato Production: Tailored to predict yields for one of the most important potato-growing regions in Canada.
Data Integration: Utilizes multiple data sources, including remote sensing, environmental variables, and agronomic traits.
Predictive Modeling: Implements regression, machine learning (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.), and semi-mechanistic HLM approaches.
Remote Sensing Insights: Incorporates vegetation indices like NDVI, GNDVI, and sLAIDI for monitoring crop health and yield potential.
Scalable Models: Designed to work across diverse regions, years, and potato varieties.
Advanced Visualizations: Provides yield maps and graphs for decision-making.
