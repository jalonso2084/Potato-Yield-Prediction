🥔 Potato Yield Prediction for Prince Edward Island (PEI)
This repository contains the code, data, and models developed to predict potato yields in Prince Edward Island, Canada. By leveraging environmental data, farming practices, and machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide accurate yield predictions that support informed decision-making for farmers, researchers, and policymakers.

🌟 Project Goals
Accurate Yield Prediction:
Develop predictive models for potato yields using historical data, weather conditions, soil properties, and farming practices.
Optimized Resource Management:
Guide farmers in improving resource efficiency (e.g., irrigation, fertilizer) and reducing environmental impact.
Accessible and Scalable Methods:
Provide a practical framework for yield prediction, focusing on methods that are reproducible and accessible.
