11  OBSERVATION STRATEGY AND SUPPORTING DATA FOR:
        Intensity level requested was for a survey at 1:20,000 scale.
        This was the approximate level of input on the cleared land,
        but somewhat less detailed in areas more difficult to traverse
        and map. Access was by both walking fields and driving roads.
        Observation density was very verible and depended upon
        familiarity of the surveyor with the terrain and the difficulty
        of access (extreme wetness and very dense shrub vegetation),
        and the complexity of soil pattern/association. Inspection
        density: Well drained 1 per 4 ha (est.). The slope phase was
        mainly derived by means of measuring 2 M contour intervals.
        Field checking proved this method to be far superior over
        sterographic interpretation. Drainage interpretation is
        dependable between the well drained and imperfect/poorly
        drained soils. Much less dependable is the moderately
        well-drained phase (short duration spring wetness) because
        soil morphology often expreses this condition very weakly.
        Lease dependable are poorly drained areas in respect to mode of
        deposition and texture (and associated predictability of
        hydraulic conductivity etc.). In many instances this would
        not affect capability for agriculture. 45 modal profiles
        published.

12  SYMBOL CONFIGURATION INCLUDING CONCEPT OF SOIL MAP UNIT:

    SOIL SERIES : EXTENT - SOIL SERIES : EXTENT - SOIL SERIES : EXTENT (*)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
                 DOMINANT SLOPE - SUBDOMINANT SLOPE

        - (*) denotes (p. (* is a plotter code pattern if 50% or more
          of the area is imperfectly or poorly drained.
        - in a single series symbol configuration teh extent is not
          indicated e.g. Al/BD

                           SOIL SERIES
                ----------------------------------
                DOMINANT SLOPE   SUBDOMINANT SLOPE

        - up to 30% of the extent of the polygon might not be
          identified because all other soils not identified in the
          symbol are less then 10% of the extent individually.

        SMUFPE75.DBF :

             Dominant slope in polygon is SLOPEP1, subdominant slope
             is SLOPEP2

            0.5 = 0-1 % slope A
            1.0 = 0-2 % slope B
            3.5 = 2-5 % slope C
            7.0 = 5-9 % slope D
            12.0 = 9-15 % slope E
            22.5 = 15-30% slope F
            37.5 = over 30% slope G
            10.0 = 5-15% slope I (dominant slope 5-9%, subdom. 9-14%)
            19.5 = 9-30% slope J (dominant slope 9-14%, subdom.
                   14-30%)
            45.0 = 45+% slope steep (STZ modifier)

        MODIFIER1, MODIFIER2 are left blank except for identifying
        soils which are shallow to bedrock. The letter D indicates
        shallow to bedrock.

        This file lists those map units which are in error in the
        UNIQUE map unit listing and indicates their corrections. The map
        unit errors are identified by 999 in the SMUFPEI.DBF.

                    O'Leary).

13  ANALYTICAL METHODS LIST [refer to McKeague if possible]:
        - pH was determined electrometrically on a soil-liquid slurry,
          using water and calcium chloride (0.01 M.CaCl2).
        - Organic matter was determined by wet combustion,
          colorometric method (Sims, J.R. and Haley, V.A. 1971 (Soil
          Sci. 112, 137-141)). Carbon was determined by induction
          furnace for profiles Tignish, O`Leary, Duvar, Margate.
        - extractable Fe, Al. oxalate and dithionite extraction were
          determined by procedures of McKeague and Day (Can. J. Soil
          Sci. 1966, 46: 13-22)
        - extractable Ca, Mg, K by atomic absorption. Extractable
          phosphorus by medium strength Bray method, calcium and
          potassium by extraction with NH4Ac adjusted to pH7. C.E.C.
          (permanent charge) extraction with 2N. NaCl after
          equilibration of the soil with 0.01 M CaCl2. Methods used
          by L.R.R.C. Analytical Services Laboratory
        - total gravel, sand, silt, clay. Pipette method, L.R.R.C.
          Analytical Service Laboratory. Organic matter content and
          iron oxides were removed by pretreatments, clay was
          determined by pipette, sand by sieving and silt by
          difference. Gravel percent is based on the total sample and
          sand, silt, clay on the total fines (less then 2mm).
        - Determination for water retension, bulk density (q/cc,
          ovendry) and hydraulic conductivity (cm/hr) were done on
          triplicate "undisturbed" core except for the 15 bar
          determination which was on loose samples.

        PLEASE NOTE: The value in the SLFPEI field KP10 is the KP6
        value and therefore a correction of (?)% less than the value
        for KP6 should be applied if the KP10 value is required. The
        value of this correction would depend on texture and 0M%. KP6
        is an acceptable value for field capacity for most PEI soils
        with FSL texture.
