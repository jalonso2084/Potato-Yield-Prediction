"10.41","The ""Soils of Canada, Derived"" national scale thematic datasets display the distribution and areal extent of soil attributes such as drainage, texture of parent material, kind of material, and classification of soils in terms of provincial Detailed Soil Surveys (DDS) polygons, Soil Landscape Polygons (SLCs), Soil Order and Great Group. The relief and associated slopes of the Canadian landscape are depicted on the local surface form thematic dataset. The purpose of the ""Soils of Canada, Derived"" series is to facilitate the cartographic display and basic queries of the Soil Landscapes of Canada at a national scale. For more detailed or sophisticated analysis, users should investigate the full ""Soil Landscapes of Canada"" product. \n\nFor more information, visit: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/8f496e3f-1e54-4dbb-a501-a91eccf616b8","Soils of Canada, Derived","9b15283a-a323-4990-ab76-d4e0ef8d9fa5","Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Government of Canada","True","0","Agro-Pedological Atlas of Quebec","-1","False","null","0","0","102100","3857","False","-20823445.177933477","381730.67725829966","-702900.6497665346","26862029.800164163","102100","3857","-15696056.48","5112202.937700003","-5830289.3477","17923775.6135","102100","3857","0","0","esriMeters","PNG32,PNG24,PNG,JPG,DIB,TIFF,EMF,PS,PDF,GIF,SVG,SVGZ,BMP","Soils of Canada, Derived","Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada","The ""Soils of Canada, Derived"" national scale thematic datasets display the distribution and areal extent of soil attributes such as drainage, texture of parent material, kind of material, and classification of soils in terms of provincial Detailed Soil Surveys (DDS) polygons, Soil Landscape Polygons (SLCs), Soil Order and Great Group.
