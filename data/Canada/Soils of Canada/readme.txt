# Dataset: Soils of Canada, Derived

## Description
The "Soils of Canada, Derived" dataset provides a national-scale overview of soil attributes such as drainage, texture of parent material, kind of material, and classification of soils. The dataset includes derived information from provincial Detailed Soil Surveys (DDS), Soil Landscape Polygons (SLCs), Soil Order, and Great Group. It also depicts the relief and slopes of the Canadian landscape.

This dataset is designed for cartographic display and basic queries, making it useful for thematic mapping and general soil analysis. For more detailed analysis, consider using the full "Soil Landscapes of Canada" dataset.
